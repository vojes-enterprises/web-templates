# Div Style Guidelines

This directory houses Vojes Enterprises `div` atoms. The Hamlet files above serve a different purpose depending what is needed. Every atom in this directory has a class assigned to it, the details of these classes will be listed below in this README.

NOTE: Any type of `div` used that isn't specified here should have a pull request submitted to add it to this directory. Any changes to the styles not specified here should have a pull request submitted to add it to this documentation.
